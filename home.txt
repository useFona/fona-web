We prioritise your flow cuz that thing matters!

Why to even open any application to make notes? 
all you need to do is select and send 
after that we got you coverd! :)



Build notes on FONA — without even being on FONA.
Why do you even need a popup? It’s about flow.

WHY FONA ? 

- creating docs while reading something can be a hassle right !?
  i mean ading a heading selecting its style allignment 
  too much to do while switching tabs 

- with fona all you need is select -> paste ! 


how it works 

we provide a web based dashboard and a extention to make your flow smooth ! 

-> web video
create a acc 
copy the token


-> add extention video
paste the token!

and all set!
